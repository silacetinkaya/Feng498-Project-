<h1>Pricely &ndash; Price Transparency &amp; Real-Time Negotiation Platform</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Pricely</strong> is a web and mobile friendly platform that helps users discover nearby businesses,
  see their service prices, and negotiate in <strong>real time</strong> with business owners.
  It aims to create a more transparent, fair, and efficient local service marketplace.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>🎯 Project Aim</h2>

<p>
  In many cities, users struggle to know what a <em>fair price</em> is for everyday services
  such as food, cleaning, repair, or personal care. Prices can change frequently and are often
  not visible in advance. This lack of transparency can lead to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overpaying for basic services,</li>
  <li>Wasted time searching for affordable options,</li>
  <li>Decreased trust in local businesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Pricely</strong> aims to reduce this uncertainty by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing a <strong>location-based platform</strong> where users can see businesses and their price lists,</li>
  <li>Allowing <strong>direct, real-time communication and negotiation</strong> with business owners,</li>
  <li>Using <strong>ratings, reviews, and photos</strong> to build community-driven trust,</li>
  <li>Highlighting top-rated services through a dynamic <strong>&quot;Best of the Day&quot;</strong> list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The platform is especially useful for <strong>students, newcomers, and tourists</strong> who need to manage
  their budgets carefully in times of high inflation and changing prices.
